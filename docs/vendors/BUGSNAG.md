# Bugsnag

[Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com) is a tool to track application exceptions. Bugsnag can
also be used to calculate the error rate. Exceptions from every application, long running
process or cron job are automatically sent to and tracked by Bugsnag. We recommend customers
track their PHP exceptions using Bugsnag.
