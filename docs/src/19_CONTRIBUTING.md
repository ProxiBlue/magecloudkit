The source files for this documentation are stored in the MageCloudKit Github repository underneath
the `docs` folder. You can simply checkout the repository and edit the Markdown source files.
The docs can be read directly in rendered Markdown on GitHub or generated using the
[static-docs](https://github.com/apex/static) tool. We have included a Makefile target for this:

    $ make docs

If your using Atom install the Terraform language plugin for syntax highlighting and other
features.
